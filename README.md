# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For data cleaning an analysis, Pandas will be used in tools such as the Jupyter Notebook development environment in order to process and clean the data. The Kaggle NBA data as well as data extracted from basketball-reference.com are both in csv formats, which pandas offers easy ways to import and process the data with dataframes, doing things like easily checking for duplicates and missing data.

## Database Storage
[Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.]

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn will be used as the Machine Learning library to process our basketball data. With the kaggle data spanning many years and the individual player data, there should be a significant amount of data points in order to train the machine learning model for the players and test on data on other years.

Logistic Regression will be our first attempt at predicting the results of a players performance in the future, but as we experiment with the datasets, the machine learning models employed and the process may change.

## Dashboard

[In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.]
