# FINAL-PROJECT

## WHY (Noman Shahid) 
  The main reason that we have created this model is for NBA team owners and scouters to take a look at player statistics and based off of that they can decide how much they think each player should get paid based off the model. There are many teams in the NBA that have players that are over or underpaid and the model that we have created can help understand player performances based off of age and seasons. 

Basketball is a sport where players usually tend to decline as they grow older but there are many players that still have good performances regardless of their age. Our machine learning model will take a look at multiple players performances as an example and demonstrate to team owners how the model can be useful and help them save money and know what players to trade or keep in the roster.
