# FINAL-PROJECT





# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For data cleaning an analysis, Pandas will be used in tools such as the Jupyter Notebook development environment in order to process and clean the data. The Kaggle NBA data as well as data extracted from basketball-reference.com are both in csv formats, which pandas offers easy ways to import and process the data with dataframes, doing things like easily checking for duplicates and missing data.

## Database Storage
For now, we are considering the use of MongoDB as a flexible NoSQL database which can be managed with tools like Compass as a GUI for the data, as well as potential integration into tools like Flask if we consider it for future parts of the project. 

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn will be used as the Machine Learning library to process our basketball data. With the kaggle data spanning many years and the individual player data, there should be a significant amount of data points in order to train the machine learning model for the players and test on data on other years.

Logistic Regression will be our first attempt at predicting the results of a players performance in the future, but as we experiment with the datasets, the machine learning models employed and the process may change.

## Dashboard

The current plan for creating a Dashboard will be taking the data we produce and using it in Tableau to display and share the data, as a flexible tool we can use with the data we have. We will be rexamining our needs and other possible ways to create a dashboard as we progress with the project.
